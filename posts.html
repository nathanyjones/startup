                    <p>What if there was an app on your iphone that let you use a particular rhythm as your 
                        password. Like, you set your password to the rhythm of a song, and then you tap on your phone to
                        that rhythm, and then your phone tracks the rhythm of your taps to determine if you got the password right.</p>

                    <p>Last night I had an idea for a video game. What if there was a game where time started going in reverse at random 
                        intervals? Like in the middle of boss fight, time suddenly reverses, and the boss heals from damage you've
                        dealt, and you have to avoid his attacks in reverse, while all of your controls are flipped.</p>
